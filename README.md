# Multiple File Renamer
A program to rename multiple files in your database in enumeration style. Easy to run and convenient for business and technical aspects for gathering data and to ensure consistent data organisation.
 If you have a large dataset filled with file names that is not arranged or seemingly convenient for the database, run the code given along with the copy address of your file.

# Steps
i) Copy the address of your file path and paste it within the quotations given in the code.<br/> 
ii) If you want to add any text along with the enumeration, add it with a +"XYZ" before the +".jpg".
